********************************************************

This is a project on overlapped speech detection in multi-party conversation meetings. We explore the effectivness of various features such as Mel Spectrogram, kurtosis etc using a neural network approach on two datasets: [TIMIT](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc93s1) and [AMI](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/). We make use of force alignment to rectify the errors inherent in human annotations of the AMI dataset.

## Dependencies
1. Python 2.7 
2. [HTK Toolkit](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/)
3. [Keras](https://keras.io/)
